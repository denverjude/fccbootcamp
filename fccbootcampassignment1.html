	HTML is written using different 'tags' with the general structure being
	<tag>
	content
	</tag>
-->
<!Doctype html> <!-- This tag is not an html teg per se but tells the browser what to expect in the file ( version of html ) -->

<html>  <!-- The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. 
		All other elements must be descendants of this element. -->


<head> <!-- This is the head tag. It provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets. There can be only one <head> element in a document.-->
</head> <!-- This closes the head tag. As mentioned above other tags are also closed similarly -->


<body> <!-- The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document. -->

<h2>What is Freecodecamp ?</h2> <!-- The HTML <h1>–<h6> elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. -->

<p>FreeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a <em>nonprofit organization<br> <!-- The HTML <p> element represents a paragraph of text.

</em>that consists of,<i> an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications, and local organizations</i> <br> <!-- The HTML <i> element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. It is typically displayed in italic type. The em tag also produces similar results but is generally more prefarable in semantics terms-->
that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.<br> <!-- The HTML <br> element produces a line break in text -->
</p>
<p>Beginning with tutorials that introduce <strong>students </strong>to <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>,<br> <!-- The HTML <b> element represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance, and that is typically rendered in boldface. The strong tag also produces similar results but is generally more prefarable in semantics terms -->
students progress to project assignments that they must complete either alone or in pairs.<br>
</p>
<p>
